Cinder/Ci Programming Language

Cinder (or Ci) is a programming language project I (Jonathan Persson) am working on as my coursework in upper secondary school. The language uses an interpreter to read code directly from a file (into memory) and then parse the instructions within it. The language (along with execution environment) is written entirely in C#.NET.

The goal of Ci is not to be a fully-functional, fast, reliable, efficient or good programming language, it is simply meant to be an easy-to-use experimental language made for the sole purpose of learning.

The above is also why anyone is free to do whatever they want to with the application and its source code. You can even sell the source code, or builds, without changing anything.
