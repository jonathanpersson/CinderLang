Cinder/Ci Programming Language

Cinder (or Ci) is a programming language project I (Jonathan Persson) am working on as my coursework in upper secondary school. The language uses an interpreter to read code directly from a file (into memory) and then parse the instructions within it. The language (along with execution environment) is written entirely in C#.NET.

The goal of Ci is not to be a fully-function, fast, reliable, efficient or good programming language, it is simply meant to be an easy-to-use experimental language.
